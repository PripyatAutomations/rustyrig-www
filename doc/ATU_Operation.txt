In order to reduce costs and use cheaply available relays, some compromises
were made. Not the end of the world as we can reliably sequence things in software.

All switching of relays carrying RF should *ONLY* be done after activating (lowering) the
TX_INHIBIT signal, to prevent hot switching the relay!

The stm32 will output this on a dedicated digital GPIO pin, in an ACTIVE LOW state.


The values for the L and C components were chosen to match the LDG AT-11 values but
the control and switching is my own design, inspired by ubitx.


By default, the ATU is bypassed by RL_BYPASS's NC contacts. When the ATU is desired,
RL_BYPASS coil should be energized.

RL_HI_Z moves the C component between inside/outside of the L network for easy
low/high Z selection.

SWR bridge provides real-time monitoring of forward and reverse power in the
antennae system and allows shutdown for high SWR to protect the finals.

Ideally you'll have at least 2 serial ports available - one for CAT and one for debug logging.
If using a posix host, you can always use sockets or pipes.

Set them in the config json below.

Edit config/$profile.config.json to reflect your target.

Optionally create/edit config/$profile.channels.json to add preset channel memories.

DEBUG MODE
----------
Debug mode attaches gdb so you can do some debugging.

The way this works depends on the host type:

	POSIX
	-----
	You just need to run 'make debug' from the source tree. Firmware will launch in debugger.

	STM32
	-----
	Attach to your DEBUG serial port and run 'make debug' from the source tree and it will connect
	to the device's GDB stub.

	ESP32
	-----

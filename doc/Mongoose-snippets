Here's some mongoose docs for things i need to hook up still
    mg_http_creds()#

    void mg_http_creds(struct mg_http_message *hm, char *user, size_t userlen,
                       char *pass, size_t passlen);

    Fetch authentication credential from the request, and store into the user, userlen and pass, passlen buffers. The credentials are looked up in the following order:

        from the Authorization HTTP header,
            Basic auth fills both user and pass
            Bearer auth fills only pass
        from the access_token cookie, fills pass
        from the ?access_token=... query string parameter, fills pass

    If none is found, then both user and pass are set to empty nul-terminated strings.

    Parameters:

        hm - HTTP message to look for credentials
        user - buffer to receive user name
        userlen - size of user buffer
        pass - buffer to receive password
        passlen - size of pass buffer

    Return value: None

    Usage example:

    // Mongoose events handler
    void fn(struct mg_connection *c, int ev, void *ev_data) {
      if (ev == MG_EV_HTTP_MSG) {
        struct mg_http_message *hm = (struct mg_http_message *) ev_data;
        char user[100], pass[100];
        mg_http_creds(hm, user, sizeof(user), pass, sizeof(pass)); // "user" is now user name and "pass" is now password from request
      }
    }
